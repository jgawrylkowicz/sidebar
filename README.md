# sidebar
Sidebar is a simple theme for Hexo — static blog generator framework — that uses Pug, Sass and PJAX for asynchronous loadings.

## Features

* PJAX: Asynchronous loading between pages using CSS transitions
* Dynamic fontsize: the text size scales up and down to the display size increasing legibility in several scenarios
* Responsive design: easily configurable breakpoints that influence the structure of the theme; the sidebar is hidden in the mobile version and replaced by a hamburger menu
* Focus: As soon as the sidebar is active, the rest of the screen will be put out of focus


### TO-DO

* Remove variables from the posts
* Work out the performance issues on some platforms
* Compress and minimize the files, reduce the overall weight of the theme
